# Bank-App

## Overview

Bank-App is a secure, full‑stack Node.js/Express banking demo with EJS views and MongoDB. It supports JWT‑based authentication, verified sign‑ups, protected account operations, and rich transaction history with statements/PDF export. It also includes strong security headers, CSRF protection, rate limiting, PWA support, diagnostics, and automated tests with CI.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT authentication with secure, httpOnly cookies
- Email verification on signup (login requires verified accounts)
- Optional Two‑Factor Authentication (TOTP via speakeasy/qrcode)
- Session usage only for 2FA flow; app is otherwise stateless via JWT

### Account & Transactions
- One account per user (enforced with unique constraint)
- Deposit funds, make payments to other account numbers
- Robust validation (account number format, self‑payment prevention, insufficient funds)
- Transaction storage with sender/receiver account numbers
- Transactions list enriched with counterparty name and email
- Transaction details page with sender/receiver identities

### Statements & PDF
- Financial statement page aggregated by account number
- Nicely styled PDF export with header, summary, and paginated rows

### Security
- Helmet with hardened CSP:
	- `upgradeInsecureRequests` and `blockAllMixedContent` (prevents mixed content)
	- `frameAncestors 'none'` (prevents clickjacking)
	- HSTS, frameguard deny, and `no-referrer` policy
- CSRF protection via cookies (bypassed only in tests)
- Express rate limiting with proxy awareness
- Trusts only first proxy hop (`app.set('trust proxy', 1)`)

### Email
- Nodemailer utility with single `sendEmail(to, subject, text)` export
- Transport `verify()` helper for diagnostics
- Signup verification email with token link

### Diagnostics & Admin
- `/health` and `/health/email` endpoints
- Admin‑only route listing at `/routes`
- Admin email test and linkage diagnostics (see controllers/routes)

### PWA
- `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` for basic offline caching of static assets

### Testing & CI
- Jest + Supertest automated tests for routes and features
- CSRF bypass in test env to enable POST route testing
- GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push/PR to `master`
